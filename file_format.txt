The Steps file will be saved in the following way:

1. Steps are shown by w-a-s-d-x according to direction NPC is moving.
2. Any number value is the value of the fruit and determines the time for the fruit to show up on board.
   To show fruit we have the following order: 
   2a. Value of Fruit.
   2b. X position to start.
   2c. Y position to start.
2. the order of the movement is as follows: fruit (if is on board) -> pacman -> ghost1 -> ... -> ghostn (1<=n<=4)

example for steps:
w a d x s d 3 a x s d


The Results file will be saved in the following way:  
1. D or W reffering whether the Pacman died or won the board
2. '####' reffering to the amount of moves passed since game started
 2a. 's' is considered a move and will be counted
 2b. when game is paused so is the move counter.
